<!-- FEATURES -->

## Features

-   10 Megastructures
-   Loot nerf
-   Buried Treasure
-   1.18 clutter blocks and new stone blocks
-   Reworked all vanilla ruins
-   Reintroduced span ruins (got removed in 1.17)
-   Custom loot tables and vanilla lore items
-   Custom and new lore for megastructures
-   Translocators on the surface
-   Vanilla friendly
-   Server-side only
-   Structures in different stone types and random stone types

One of my goals with this mod would be to let it be community driven and everyone suggests or add ideas/builds to this while still staying as close to vanilla as possible. That would result into frequent updates as well.
